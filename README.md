# Spell Correction using Minimum Edit Distance (MED)
This experiment uses the MED **(Lavenshtein distance)** algorithm to find the correct spelling of misspelled words in the **Birkbeck** corpus from the **WordNet** dictionary. Where k={1, 5, 10}, the average success at k, is calculated.

**Keywords:** Spell correction, Lavenshtein distance, Corpus, Dictionary, Natural Language Processing.

## The Data
Two files, [SHEFFIELDDAT.643](https://github.com/gloryodeyemi/COMP_8730_Assignment1/blob/main/Data/SHEFFIELDDAT.643) and [FAWTHROP1DAT.643](https://github.com/gloryodeyemi/COMP_8730_Assignment1/blob/main/Data/FAWTHROP1DAT.643), out of the Birkbeck spelling error corpus by Roger Mitton was used for this experiment. They contain 1,193 words misspelled words in total and the correct equivalent of these words.

The WordNet dictionary contains 147,306 words.
